## Module 1 Assessment Starter Kit

This project will serve as the jumping-off point for several module one assessment challenges. Before your assessment, you should clone this repository, `bundle`, and make sure all the tests pass by running `rake`.

Then, spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the structure and contents of the project. So far it contains a single Ruby class, `Recipe`, and some accompanying tests.

#### Running Tests

From the project's root, `rake` like a boss.

#### Installing Dependencies

You will probably the gems needed for this project already on your machine, but if not, `bundle`.
